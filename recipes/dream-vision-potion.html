                    Unveil the secrets of the dream world using the Dream Vision Potion, which is created by the mysterious Merelin. It opens up gates to visions of other realms and unexplored dreams. Mysterious ingredients combined with careful processes make it an elaborate dance of components. It takes but a single drop to perceive what is unseen, yet be careful—balance is at stake. Two drops can deluge the senses, and three. better that some things be left unuttered.

                            <li>Crunch the Jade Mint with whatever you can find and put it in a container.</li>
                            <li>Add a sprinkle of liquid ice to turn it into messy water, then add the Cliff Lavender, one half at a time until you've added three parts.

                            <li>Fill a pan with living water, but kill it first, add the mixture and gently, very gently bring it to a simmer.</li>
                            <li>Let it simmer for a while, you've earned a break before adding the Hate Leaves and Mage Catnip, in reverse order.</li>
                            <li>Gently warm up the mixture once more, mix in the Flux Anise and let everything cool down to room temperature.</li>
                            <li>Stir everything a final time to thoroughly mix everything.</li>

                        Your potion is ready to be used. One droplet is enough for the potion to work. Two droplets would be overkill. Three droplets would be, well, why would anybody dare use three droplets.
